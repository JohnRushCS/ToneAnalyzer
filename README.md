# Tone Analyzer

A Module for determining the particular Chinese tone that is present in an audio file. This module uses machine learning techniques such as gradient descent to develop a model for what an audio sample should look like for each of the four chinese tones, and then will determine which tone a new model is based on the model that best represents the inputted audio sample.
